  desc: "A PyTorch implementation of the U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of roads in aerial imagery."
  full_desc: >
    This project demonstrates **aerial image segmentation using a U-Net architecture implemented in PyTorch**.
    It aims to accurately detect **road networks** from aerial or satellite imagery, crucial for urban planning, autonomous navigation, and geospatial analysis.
    Built as a portfolio project to showcase deep learning expertise in computer vision and semantic segmentation.
    Utilized a subset of the Massachusetts Roads Dataset and achieved clear segmentation of road networks using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient metrics.
  technologies: "PyTorch, U-Net (Encoder-Decoder), NumPy, OpenCV, TorchVision, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab"
  outcome: "Implemented U-Net for semantic segmentation, used real-world dataset (Massachusetts Roads), achieved clear road network segmentation."
